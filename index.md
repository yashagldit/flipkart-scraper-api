## Increasing Resolution of Image

You can increase the resolution of image by changing certain parameters in the thumbnail link.

For example, in the link :

```;
https://rukminim2.flixcart.com/image/312/312/kzfvzww0/computer/r/g/i/hp-laptop-15s-eq2144au-amd-ryzen-5-5500u-8gb-ddr4-512-gb-pcie-original-imagbg5jctdf4xwf.jpeg?q=70
```

The *312/312* describes the resolution. Just change it to *1024/1024* for product image.

```;
https://rukminim2.flixcart.com/image/1024/1024/kzfvzww0/computer/r/g/i/hp-laptop-15s-eq2144au-amd-ryzen-5-5500u-8gb-ddr4-512-gb-pcie-original-imagbg5jctdf4xwf.jpeg?q=70
```

## Deployment

### Deploy using Docker

- Fork and clone the repository on your system.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api.git
    cd flipkart-scraper-api
    ```

- Build docker image.

    ```bash
    docker build . --tag flipkart-scraper-api
    ```

- Start container from image.

    ```bash
    docker run -p3000:3000 localhost/flipkart-scraper-api
    ```

- API is now running actively on localhost with port 3000.
- This by default uses express js to serve routes. If you want exact behaviour replicated, you can run docker container with command `test`.

    ```bash
    docker run -p3000:3000 localhost/flipkart-scraper-api test
    ```

### Deploy with Cloudflare Workers

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api)

### Deploy with NodeJS

- Make sure `node` and some package manager are installed on your system.
- Fork and clone the repository on your system.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api.git
  cd flipkart-scraper-api
  ```

- Install required dependencies.

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Run the server.

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

- You can optionally run using Cloudflare's official wrangler tool as well.

## Accuracy

- Search API

    The Search API is tested with lot of products and compared thoroughly and is found to be accurate for all of them till date, thanking to the self adjusting different fetch methods. The Flipkart website doesn't have any standard `id` or `class` or `name` to the components of website making it far more difficult to scrape and create API from. However, there may be inaccuracy in case of some product ( `null` result ). In case, if someone encounter with some other error, convey it to me through [Telegram](https://t.me/dvishal485) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api/issues) containing the following information :
  - Search keyword
  - Information you find wrong
  - Fetch Method
  - JSON response received ( if possible )

- Product API

    The Product API was found to be completely error free during the testing, so hopefully it will remain the same in future. I have ensured that you get maximum of Flipkart's data which may not be present in other alternatives. Especially without any authorisation. If you still encounter anything unexpected, [raise an issue](https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api/issues)

---

## Error Handling

  In case of any error you will receive an error message in the following format :

```json
{
  "error_message": "ERROR MESSAGE",
  "possible_solution": "POSSIBLE SOLUTION",
  "bug_report": "https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api/issues"
}
```
  
  **Note :** In case the API can't find Product URL or Name of Product, it will be set to `null`. Hence always null check the result.
  
  [If you are facing unexpected results then Raise An Issue](https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api/issues)
